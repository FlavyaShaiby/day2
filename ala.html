    <P>Alappuzha has a diverse topography. It is a sandy strip of land intercepted by lagoons, rivers and canals. There are neither mountains nor hills in the district except some scattered hillocks lying between Bharanikkavu and Chengannur blocks in the eastern portion of the district. Cherthala, Ambalappuzha, Kuttanad and Karthikappally Taluks fully lie in low land region. 80% of the district lies in coastal region and the rest in midland region.The district has a contiguous long coastline of 82 Km. Alappuzha is the only district where there is no high land and forest area in Kerala. Water bodies constitute 13% of the district and Kuttanad area lies below sea level.</P>
